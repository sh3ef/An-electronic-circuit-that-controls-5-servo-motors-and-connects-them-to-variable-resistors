An electronic circuit that controls 5 servo motors, and programmed them to put all the motors at 90 degrees and connects them to variable resistors

**For this task, I designed a circuit that would control five servo motors, the usefulness of which is based on the fact that they will be the joints of the robot arm. This circuit contains five variable resistors, each resistor associated with a specific servo and is programmed to be able to move only with a rotation angle of 90 degrees.**
